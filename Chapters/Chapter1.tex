The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 27 km proton-proton synchrotron. 
From 2009-2013 it has operated at $\sqrt{s}=7-8TeV$ providing around $25fb^{-1}$ of data (Run 1). The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector (described in detail in \cite{CMSTDR}) is one of two general purpose detectors which have performed exceptionally well during Run 1.  After the long shutdown to upgrade both the LHC and detectors for operation at $\sqrt{s}=13$, Run 2 has begun and presents an excellent opportunity to discover physics beyond the standard model (SM).
Supersymmetry (SUSY) is among the most promising candidates for this new physics. A leading search for SUSY is \alphat, an all-hadronic final state search. This has provided stringent constraints on SUSY in Run 1 \cite{CMSAT8}. The focus of this report will be on studies to improve the sensitivity and robustness of this search for Run 2.

\section {Supersymmetry}
SUSY is an additional symmetry connecting each particle to a heavier superpartner. 
Low mass ($TeV$ scale) SUSY is motivated by cancellation of the quadratically divergent loop corrections to the Higgs boson. 
This requires a small splitting between the third generation squark masses and the top to avoid fine tuning 
\cite{naturalness}. 
In R-parity conserving SUSY \cite{susywimp} the supersymmetric particles are pair produced and 
decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). This is a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) and therefore a Dark Matter (DM) candidate which may account for
 various astrophysical observations of gravitational excesses compared to the observed baryonic matter
\cite{dm}. The pair production of coloured sparticles
can be expected to result in a signature containing
jets (especially those originating from b quarks if the third
generation squarks are light) 
with energies determined by the mass splitting of the
SUSY spectrum and missing momentum (\met) from the LSP.  

% \section{CMS Detector}
%
% %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS \cite{CMSTDR}) is one of two general purpose detectors at the LHC  
% It is described in detail in \cite{CMS}. 
% The coordinate system used by CMS takes the origin at the collision point. 
% The z-axis points along the beam direction and defines the azimuthal angle, $\phi$. 
% The psuedorapidity is defined by the polar angle, $\theta$, as $\eta=-ln(tan(\theta/2))$. 
% The coverage of CMS is $|\eta|<5$. 
% Transverse energies and momenta ($E_T $ and $p_T$) are defined perpendicular to the beam \cite{cmsiop}. Significant features for the \alphat analysis are described below.
%
% Charged particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip tracker \cite{siliconTDR} 
% in order to find their momentum (reliant on the 3.8T solenoid).
% The CMS tracker achieves $15\mu m$ accuracy and a 1\% resolution for a particle with momentum 
% up to $p_T < 40GeV$ with coverage for $|\eta|<2.5$. 
% Muons are measured in the range $|\eta|<2.4$ and a $p_T$ resolution from $1-5\%$ can be achieved 
% for $p_T < 1Tev$. The ECAL measures the energy of incident photons and electrons with a resolution better  than $0.5\%$ for $E_T > 100 GeV$. The barrel provides
%  coverage up to $|\eta| < 1.4$ and is extended to 
%   $|\eta|<3$ by the endcap. The HCAL has coverage of $|\eta|<3.0$ \cite{hcal} and a resolution for $E_T > 100GeV$ of 11\%. 
%   When combined with the ECAL jets can be measured to a
%   resolution of $\Delta E/E \approx 100 \%/\sqrt{E[GeV]} \oplus 5\%$.
% Potentially interesting events are selected by the Level 1 (L1) 
% hardware trigger which reduces the data rate from $\mathcal{0}40MHz$ to $100kHz$. 
% These events are then processed in the HLT which utilises 
% all detector information to further reduce the rate 
% to $\mathcal{O}1kHz$.
