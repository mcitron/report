The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 27 km proton-proton synchrotron. From 2009-2013 it has operated at $\sqrt{s}=7-8TeV$ delivering a luminosity (L) of $6 \times 10^{33} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ with a bunch spacing of $50ns$\cite{run1}. This has provided around $25fb^{-1}$ of data which has been used to complete the Standard Model (SM) with the discovery of the Higgs boson and placed new models of physics under intense scrutiny\cite{cmshiggs}\cite{atlashiggs}\cite{susyr1}. Supersymmetry is the leading contender to replace the SM. This makes direct searches for SUSY a significant part of the work carried out at the LHC. The focus of this report will be $\alpha_T$, an all-hadronic final state search which has shown great strength in Run 1\cite{search}. 

Currently the LHC and detectors have been shut down for a range of upgrades to allow design conditions to be reached\cite{ls1}. From mid-2015 it is expected that the improvements will allow $\sqrt{s}=13-14TeV$ while increasing the luminosity and halving the bunch spacing. The jump in energy especially will make the coming years key in determining the existence of low energy SUSY by dramatically increasing the production probability for supersymmetric particles (sparticles)\cite{ProjectedCx}.
